# Architecture — ShipRight

**Status: Public draft (v0.4.0-draft).**
**Tagline:** Context before generate. Product before pixels.

This file is a map of the pack. It is not a tutorial and not application code architecture.

## What this pack is

A small system that forces **context before generate** and **product before pixels**. Three agent skills frame the product, decide behavior, craft UI specifications, write build inputs for AI design and coding tools, and critique what gets built with evidence-based checks. Five optional templates record context and decisions. The goal is to stop AI tools from inventing random UI and flows.

**ShipRight's job next to visual-craft packs (Taste Skill, Hallmark, UI UX Pro Max, Impeccable):** a multi-screen product frame (outcome → differentiating system → objects → journey → screen jobs), explicit decision ownership, and stage-bounded readiness, in plain Markdown with no install tooling. Pair with those packs; do not bundle them.

**Anti-slop** = capability language (checks that block generic AI UI). **ShipRight** = product name.

### Ownership

| Path | Owns | Does not own |
|------|------|--------------|
| `docs/` | Recorded context and decisions (requirements, systems, security, frontend, tickets) | Runtime code; approval by itself |
| `skills/_shared/` | Depth, intake, decision ownership, evidence and readiness | Skill-specific craft rules |
| `skills/product-design/` | Product frame, flows, states, decisions, risks, optional opportunity research, decision gate | Pixel styling, fake research |
| `skills/ui-ux-design/` | Layout, hierarchy, components, a11y, references, design-system direction, build handoff pack, pre-flight | Product strategy, pricing |
| `skills/ux-critique/` | Findings, severity, product audit, bounded verification, audit | Inventing new product scope |
| `personal-taste/` | Optional preference overlays (merge, don’t rewrite cores) | Core skill bodies |
| `examples/` | Teaching samples | Source of truth for a real product |

## Progressive loading (how agents should read)

1. **Metadata** — skill `name` + `description` in each `SKILL.md` frontmatter (choose the right skill)
2. **Context and authority** — current request, relevant project sources and `skills/_shared/operating-contract.md`; then shared intake (state the depth)
3. **Instructions** — full `SKILL.md` body when the skill activates
4. **Personal taste** — if `personal-taste/` has files, load for ui-ux defaults
5. **References** — files under `skills/*/references/` only when the depth or task calls for them
6. **Docs** — relevant context for the commitment; help draft missing sections without inventing approvals
7. **Gates** — run the skill's numbered gate at handoff or when readiness is requested

Do not load every reference on every turn. Keep the skill body lean; put depth in `references/`.

## Skill flow (simple)

```text
relevant context (approved decisions preserved) + depth
      │
      ▼
product-design  →  Frame product (new product / rough idea)  →  user approves frame
      │            (optional opportunity research, only if the user agrees)
      ▼
product-design  →  flows, states  →  8-check DECISION GATE at handoff
      │
      ▼
ui-ux-design    →  screen specs (+ optional references, design-system direction)  →  10-check PRE-FLIGHT
      │
      ▼
ux-critique     →  specification review
      │
      ▼
ui-ux-design    →  BUILD HANDOFF PACK (rules block + one prompt per screen)
      │
      ▼
your build tool →  screens / code
      │
      ▼
ux-critique     →  critique + bounded verification of the actual result (max 2 fix passes)
```

If critique finds a **wrong decision** (not just a visual issue), route back to **product-design**, not only to ui-ux-design.

## Countable gates summary

| Skill | Gate name | Checks | When |
|-------|-----------|--------|------|
| product-design | Decision gate | 8 | Product handoff |
| ui-ux-design | Pre-flight | 10 | Decided build handoff |
| ux-critique | Audit | 10 | Named review stage |

## Hard boundaries

**IS**

- Product frame and decisions with a clear trail
- Light guided intake sized by depth (never a novel questionnaire)
- State coverage (empty, loading, error, success, denied, partial)
- UI/UX specs and build inputs grounded in approved decisions
- Honest critique with severity and evidence
- Evidence-based checks with stable IDs

**IS NOT**

- Treating proposed scope, roles or screens as approved requirements
- Treating a competitor's missing feature as demand or scope
- Fake user interviews or fake metrics
- Dark patterns
- Legal, medical, or compliance advice as if it were certified
- A coding-agent framework, CLI, hooks or detector tooling
- Three divergent copies of the same skill for Claude / Cursor / Codex (one `skills/` source of truth)
- A bundle of other skill packs

## How to extend safely

1. Add depth in `references/`, not by growing `SKILL.md` past a readable length
2. Keep intake DRY via `skills/_shared/intake.md`
3. Put preference files in `personal-taste/` — do not fork core skills
4. Update `skills.md` catalog and `CHANGELOG.md`
5. Keep folder names `lowercase-with-hyphens` matching frontmatter `name`
6. Do not duplicate skill text into tool-specific folders — use copy or symlink from `skills/`
7. Use the shared evidence statuses/readiness rule; check counts are coverage, not proof of quality

## What rarely changes

- Method order: outcome → differentiating system → objects/states → journey → screen jobs → honest critique → preserved decisions
- No invented facts, validation or approval; unknowns block only affected commitments
- Split of ownership across the three skills
- Tagline: Context before generate. Product before pixels.
