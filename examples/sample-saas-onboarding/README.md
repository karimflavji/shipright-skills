# Teaching example: invite a teammate

**Pack:** ShipRight  
**Status: DRAFT; fictional Acme Team.**
**Tagline:** Context before generate. Product before pixels.

## What is actually supplied

- `filled-01-prd-excerpt.md`: fictional product context, including unresolved expiry and delivery questions.
- `sample-skill-outputs.md`: an inline written specification and illustrative evaluations of it.

There are no filled docs 02–05, screenshots, generated interfaces or running applications in this example. Do not assume attachments or passing runtime evidence. This is a teaching example, not a benchmark or an observed before/after comparison.

## What it teaches

1. Keep delegated and user-reserved decisions separate.
2. Use the actual PRD excerpt and inline specification; do not imagine missing documents.
3. Keep a required behavior Fail when it is missing, even if a ticket names an owner.
4. Mark unavailable evidence Not verified and irrelevant features Not applicable.
5. Give the next correction without claiming the whole product is ready to ship.

The sample keeps the existing three skills and 8/10/10 check IDs. It does not require more process or add product features.

## Try it

> Use product-design with the PRD excerpt and inline specification in sample-skill-outputs.md. Identify current decisions, user-reserved choices and the next necessary behavior. Do not implement or send invitations.

> Use ui-ux-design on that written specification. Evaluate specification readiness using only supplied evidence. Do not add filters or new screens to satisfy a checklist.

> Use ux-critique on specification v1 in sample-skill-outputs.md. Report the named review stage and readiness for builder handoff. A tracked issue is still unresolved; visual and runtime evidence are absent.

These prompts are teaching aids that explain the expected method. They are not independent evaluation inputs. Focused behavioral tests use separate task-local prompts without the expected answer.

## Scope of proof

A written example can demonstrate the intended rules. It does not establish better output than another skill, runtime accessibility, email delivery, authorization enforcement or client installation reliability. Those require their own evidence.
