# UX Critique Skill — ShipRight

**Status: Public draft.**
**Pack version:** 0.3.0-draft  
**Pack name:** **ShipRight** (locked)  
**Tagline:** Context before generate. Product before pixels.

## 1. Purpose

Review specifications, screens and flows for actionable UX findings. Use the existing **10-gate audit** with stage-appropriate evidence; only implementation evidence can support implementation readiness.

### IS

- Structured critique with severity
- Slop detection (generic dashboards, random gradients, happy-path-only, purple SaaS tells)
- Rewrite asks tied to docs when docs exist
- Countable ship gate — not vibes

### IS NOT

- A substitute for a missing PRD
- Fake personas or invented interview quotes
- Full visual redesign (hand to **ui-ux-design** after decisions are sound)
- Product strategy from scratch (hand to **product-design**)
- A huge questionnaire

## INTAKE

Apply [the shared operating contract](../_shared/operating-contract.md) for decision ownership, missing context, evidence statuses and readiness. Use [shared intake](../_shared/intake.md); do not repeat questions already answered.

Identify the artifact/version, review stage, user job and requested next step. Ask only when one of these is materially unclear; do not default a specification review to release certification.

**You decide** delegates only the named choice. **Let me decide** reserves it for the user. Blank answers stay unresolved; continue independent work.

**Core rules if `../_shared` is unreachable (say so):** You decide = only the named choice. Let me decide = the user keeps it. Blank or silence = unresolved, never approval. Statuses: Pass · Fail · Not verified · Not applicable (with reason). A ticket, owner or plan never turns Fail into Pass; a stage-critical Fail is a Blocker. Spec ≠ screenshot ≠ implementation evidence. Readiness never authorizes deploy, publish or payment.

## 2. When to use / When NOT

**Use when** a written specification, mock, generated output, or coded UI exists and someone asks: review, critique, audit, find issues, is this shippable? Also use when a build tool has produced screens from a ShipRight build handoff pack: compare the result with the approved screen jobs and states.

**Do NOT use when** there is no artifact to review — request the smallest relevant specification, screen or result. Use **product-design** if the user needs help shaping it. Do not use as pure brand illustration feedback.

## 3. Review evidence

Name Specification, Visual artifact or Implementation in the review header, with the exact artifact/version and requested next stage. A written flow is a reviewable specification. It is not a rendered or tested interface.

| Available input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Artifact + relevant context | Evaluate against current decisions; identify unapproved deviations |
| Artifact + incomplete context | Review supported properties; mark affected product conclusions unknown rather than inventing scope |
| No artifact | Ask for the smallest relevant spec, screen or result; do not claim to have reviewed an imaginary attachment |

Read the shared contract before scoring. Missing evidence is Not verified, not an automatic Fail or Pass.

## 4. Critique lenses

Work through each lens. Skip a lens only if truly N/A and say why.

1. **Clarity** — Can a new user tell what this screen is for in 5 seconds?  
2. **Flow** — Are steps necessary? Dead ends? Missing back/cancel?  
3. **Hierarchy** — Is the primary action obvious? Is noise competing?  
4. **States** — Empty / loading / error / success / denied present and distinct?  
5. **Trust** — Honest copy? Scary permissions explained? No dark patterns?  
6. **Accessibility** — Contrast, focus, keyboard, not color-only, touch size?  
7. **AI slop tells** — See `references/slop-tells.md`; distinguish integrity failures from contextual visual preferences

## 5. Severity rubric

Use `references/severity-rubric.md`. Short form:

| Severity | Meaning | Ship rule |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **Blocker** | Stops the job, causes harm, major access failure, **or fails any stage-critical requirement** | Do not pass this stage |
| **Major** | Noncritical: substantial friction with a usable, understood workaround | Record impact and explicit disposition |
| **Polish** | Visual/copy nits that do not block the job | Backlog OK |

## 6. Output format

Lead with the verdict and next action (120 words or fewer). Then findings, then the audit table. At Quick fix depth, skip the table.

**Product audit (optional; existing product, Focused improvement depth).** When the user wants an existing product improved or ready for launch, put this block above the findings:

```text
## Product audit — [scope]
Top 3 problems (by user impact, not fix difficulty):
1. …
What's working (keep it):
- …
Root cause behind several problems:
- …
Patch or rethink: [one honest call + why]
```

Audit one lane per session (one flow, one screen, or one dimension). Do not reopen approved decisions; route a wrong decision to product-design.

```text
## Critique summary

- Critical requirements for this stage:

- Docs available: yes/partial/no (list gaps)
- Verdict: Re-decide / Fix first / Needs decision (D#) / Not established / Ready for [stage]
- Next action (one line):

## 10-gate ship audit
| # | Gate | Status | Evidence / next action |
|---|------|--------|------------------------|

## Next steps

```

### Rewrite ask quality

Bad: “Make it nicer.”  
Good: “Replace gradient hero with brand token background from doc 04; keep one primary CTA — Invite teammate.”

## 7. What never to invent

- Fake user quotes (“Users said…”) without sources  
- Fake metrics (“this will lift conversion 20%”)  
- New features to “engage” users not in PRD  
- Legal conclusions  

If research is needed, say **unknown — needs research**, do not fabricate.

## 8. Routing

| Finding type | Route to |
|--------------|----------|
| Wrong flow / wrong decision / missing job | **product-design** |
| Layout, hierarchy, visual slop, a11y craft, dials/pre-flight | **ui-ux-design** |
| Permissions / roles wrong | doc **03** + product-design |
| Ticket / AC update | doc **05** |

## 9. Audit (10 checks; evidence for the named stage)

Run the table when a readiness claim is requested or at a handoff. For a Quick fix, give a one-line readiness note instead.

Use the shared contract's four statuses and readiness rule. Define critical requirements before scoring. Every relevant check needs evidence and next action tied to the artifact/version in the header. A finding, owner or ticket never substitutes for meeting the requirement. Defer only noncritical work, with explicit disposition; the check remains Fail or Not verified as appropriate.

| # | Gate | Criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Artifact | A real specification, screen or implementation is identified, not an assumed attachment |
| 2 | Context honesty | Claims are supported by available context; missing facts and scope limits are explicit |
| 3 | Job clarity | The artifact communicates its job; label heuristic judgment rather than claiming user testing |
| 4 | Action hierarchy | Primary/contextual actions serve the user's task and current product decisions |
| 5 | States | Required behavior is specified or verified at this stage; a missing required state remains Fail when ticketed |
| 6 | Blockers | No unresolved Blocker in the reviewed scope; lack of evidence does not prove none exists |
| 7 | Craft | Specific hierarchy/content/interaction defects are addressed; visual evidence unavailable means Not verified |
| 8 | Trust | Cost, permissions, action effects and evidence are honest; taste cannot waive them |
| 9 | Accessibility | Evidence fits this stage; screenshots cannot verify keyboard behavior or implementation compliance |
| 10 | Rewrite path | Findings have concrete corrections and retest conditions; this does not resolve their underlying failures |

**Verdict:** Re-decide the affected premise; otherwise Fix first for a critical failure or open Blocker; otherwise Needs decision (D#) when the only open items are the user's own decisions; otherwise Not established for an unverified critical requirement; otherwise Ready for the named next stage with explicit noncritical dispositions. This applies to all ten checks. Readiness does not grant external-action permission.

## 10. Quality gate (skill completeness)

- [ ] Intake asked only material unanswered questions, at most five per round
- [ ] Review stage, artifact/version and context limits stated
- [ ] Each finding has severity + rewrite ask  
- [ ] No fake quotes  
- [ ] Slop lens considered  
- [ ] **10-gate audit** uses honest statuses and evidence
- [ ] Blockers clearly called out
